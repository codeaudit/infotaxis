# infotaxis

This code provides a 2-D implementation of the 'infotaxis' algorithm as described in ['Infotaxis' as a strategy for searching without gradients](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v445/n7126/abs/nature05464.html), by Vergassola, Villermaux, and Shraiman (*Nature* 2007).

All code is Python 3 and is best run using the [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) Python installation.
