ID: make_geom_config_group_wind_tunnel_matched
TYPE: data_generating
Looks up all starting positions from wind tunnel data and converts them to infotaxis-discretized starting indexes.

ID: generate_wind_tunnel_matched_trials
TYPE: data_generating
Generate a set of trajectories inside a theoretical wind tunnel using starting positions and trajectory durations taken
from actual wind tunnel data.

ID: extend_wind_tunnel_matched_geom_configs_with_trajectory_ids
TYPE: data_cleaning
Go through wind tunnel database and note actual trajectory ids associated with each geom_config.

ID: generate_wind_tunnel_matched_trials_one_for_one
TYPE: data_generating
Generate a set of trajectories inside a theoretical wind tunnel using starting positions and trajectory durations taken
from actual wind tunnel data. Like 'generate_wind_tunnel_matched_trials', but making sure to generate one infotaxis trial for every wind tunnel trial.

ID: make_wind_tunnel_discretized_geom_configs
TYPE: data_generating
Use specified environment discretization to calculate the starting position idxs and discretized trial durations and save them in the database.

ID: generate_discretized_wind_tunnel_trajectory_copies
TYPE: data_generating
Load all wind tunnel trajectories and make discretized copies of them for direct comparison with infotaxis-begotten trajectories. This requires make_wind_tunnel_discretized_geom_configs to be run first so that the correct geom_configs can be bound to discretized trajectories.

ID: fix_collimated_plume_thresholds_of_odor_none_and_afterodor_in_db
TYPE: data_editing
Go through all of the plumes corresponding to the none and afterodor simulations and change their threshold values to -1, since these weren't actually stored correctly in the plume class.

ID: generate_wind_tunnel_matched_trials_one_for_one
TYPE: data_generating
Create one trial for each wind tunnel trajectory. Use the geometrical configurations calculated by discretizing trajectories.
